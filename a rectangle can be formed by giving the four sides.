Determine whether a rectangle can be formed by giving the four sides. Such that length of its sides are a, b, c and d (in any order)

program:
a = float(input("The length of the rectangle side a: "))
b = float(input("The length of the rectangle side b: "))
c = float(input("The length of the rectangle side c: "))
d = float(input("The length of the rectangle side d: "))
if (a + b > c + d) and (a + c > b + d) and (a + d > b + c):
    print("A rectangle can be formed with sides a, b, c, and d.")
else:
    print("A rectangle cannot be formed with sides a, b, c, and d.")

 output:The length of the rectangle side a: 2
The length of the rectangle side b: 3
The length of the rectangle side c: 2
The length of the rectangle side d: 3
A rectangle cannot be formed with sides a, b, c, and d.
